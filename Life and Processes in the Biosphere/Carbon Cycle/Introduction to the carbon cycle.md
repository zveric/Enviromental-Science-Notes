- **Stores** (pools/reservoirs): The amounts of carbon held in the global system. eg: the atmosphere, oceans and biosphere
- **Flows** (the rate of flow is sometime called a flux): Movements or transfers of carbon between stores. eg: volcanic activity adds 0.1 giga-tonnes of carbon annually
- **Processes**: The physical mechanisms that drive inputs. eg: CO2 is added to the atmosphere by human activities
- Flows into stores are called **inputs**
- Flows leaving stores are called **outputs**
- The relative rate of these fluxes are important

## Photosynthesis
- The capture of light energy by chlorophyll
- The conversion of carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates
- Oxygen is a by product

## Respiration 
- The release of energy from carbohydrates, to drive metabolic processes
- Anaerobic respiration can break down organic components more fully and release much more energy than anaerobic respiration
- Carbon dioxide is a by product
- Anaerobic allows some organisms to survive and use food sources in oxygen deficient environments

## Dissolving/Exolving
- CO<sub>2</sub> dissolves in the ocean some of it stays as gas but most react with the water to form carbolic acid

## Food chains
- The passage of organic compounds as food between organisms
- This is a biomass movement

## Changes in carbon reservoirs
- Fossilisation
- Weathering

## Fossil fuels
- The incomplete decomposition of organisms, under anoxic conditions, leading to the deposition of fossil fuels

## Fossilisation
- The absorption of carbon dioxide by marine organisms, its storage in their skeleton and subsequent deposition on the seabed.

## Weathering
- Breaking down of rocks without movement due to chemical processes
- Rainwater in the atmosphere picks up CO<sub>2</sub> creating carbolic acid
- Rainwater then dissolves lime stone releasing CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere

## Combustion
- The release of carbon dioxide by the burning of organic substances

## Decomposition
- The break down of organic matter by micro organisms into dead organic matter, releasing gases such as carbon dioxide under aerobic conditions and methane under anaerobic conditions
