- Nitrogen is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere, but it cannot be absorbed as N2 by plants or animals.

## Bacteria's Role in the nitrogen cycle
- Nitrogen fixation - Conversion of N2 into ammonia NH3
- Breakdown of dead organic matter - release of ammonium NH4+
- Conversion of ammonium to nitrates NO2- then to nitrates NO3- this allows nitrates to be absorbed by plants
- Denitrification - conversion of nitrates to N2

# Processes in the nitrogen cycle
## Ionisation
- Lightning 

## Fixation
- Micro-organisms reduce nitrogen to ammonia either in the soil or in root nodules

## Food chains
- Amino acids and proteins in food

## Nitrification
- Oxidisation of ammonium ions to nitrates, then to nitrates by bacteria in the soil

## Denitrification
- Reduction of ammonium ions to nitrates in anaerobic conditions 

## Leaching
- Nitrates are soluble

## Root absorption
- Plants absorb nitrogen as nitrates and ammonium ions

## Ammonification 
- Bacteria and fungi release ammonium from amino acids in proteins
