## Carrying Capacity
- The carrying capacity is the greatest population that an area/habitat can support without causing damage to that environment or over-exploiting it.
- The mortality changes depending on whether the population is above or below the carrying capacity.

### R-selected species
- The r stands for reproduction
- The species have very high reproduction rate 
- Babies grow quickly
- Found in less competitive low quality habitats
- They tend to reach sexual maturity quickly as they often have high mortality rates
- Examples include: Rabbits and rats

### K-selected species
- The k stands for carrying species
- the babies enter a competitive world in a population at or near its carrying capacity
- These animals tend to nurture their young and invest heavily in a few offspring at a time
- Their populations recover slowly after a crash
- Although not always the case k-selection is more common in larger animals like whales or elephants with longer lifespans and overlapping generations
- Examples include: Elephants and whales

### Maximum sustainable yield
- This is how far we can exploit a population without causing a long term population decline
