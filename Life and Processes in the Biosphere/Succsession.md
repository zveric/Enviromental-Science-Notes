## Primary Succession
- Primary succession is the process of new barren land becoming inhabited by a range of species
- Primary succession takes a much longer time than secondary succession as the soil doesn't exist.
1. Lichen and mosses inhabit the new land first eventually creating a thin layer of soil as it dies and decays this makes them a pioneer species
2. Small seeds that are carried through the wind begin to be able to grow in the thin layer of soil
3. The soil layer increases in size as the plants die and decay.
4. This allows bigger and bigger plants to inhabit the area. 
5. These bigger plants allow animals to begin to inhabit the area.
6. These animals defecated furthering the depth of the soil
7. This process increases until a climax community is formed.

## Secondary Succession
- Secondary Succession id similar to primary succession however it occurs quicker due to the presence of soil
- The lichen build up isn't needed and seeds can instantly colonise the area.

## Climax Community
- A climax community is the final stage of succession remaining relatively unchanged until destroyed by an event such as fire or human interference.

## Deflated Succession 
- Human activities stop an area of land reaching a climax community
- Examples include land used for grazing.
	- Areas of heath land are burned creating grass land for agriculture and grouse shooting
