-   Phosphorus is an essential nutrient found in molecules of humans and other organisms, including DNA and RNA.
-   The phosphorus cycle is slow. Most phosphorus in nature exists in the form of phosphate ions.
-   Phosphorus is often the **limiting nutrient**, or nutrient that is most scarce and thus limits growth, in aquatic ecosystems.
-   When nitrogen and phosphorus from fertiliser are carried in runoff to lakes and oceans, they can cause **eutrophication**, the overgrowth of algae. The algae may deplete oxygen from the water and create a **dead zone**.







## Water 
- Dissolved phosphates

## Rocks
- Phosphates trapped in rocks

## Plants and Animals
- In bones 
- In ATP and DNA

## Sustainable Management of the Phosphorous Cycle
- Every-time a farmer harvests phosphorus is taken from the soil
- This phosphorus needs to be replaced
- Mining isn't sustainable 
- Biological waste is the most sustainable fertiliser
