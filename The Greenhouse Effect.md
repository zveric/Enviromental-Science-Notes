 - The earths climate is regulated by greenhouse gasses.
 - Visible light passes through the atmosphere easily
 - This light is absorbed by the earth which warms up
 - The warmed earth emmits this heat back into the atmosphere in the form of infrared radiation
 - Greenhouse gasses such as Carbon dioxide and Methane trap infrared radiation emmited by the earth within the troposphere
 - This Greenhouse effect keeps the earth at a stable temperature
 - The greenhouse effect is kept at an equalibrium. When human disrupt this natural equalibrium [[anthropogenic climate change]] can occur
