- Simpsons biodiversity index is a way to measure and compare the biodiversity of different communities
- The value for Simpson’s Diversity Index ranges between 0 and 1. The higher the value, the lower the diversity.
- Since this interpretation is a bit counter-intuitive, we often calculate **Simpson’s Index of Diversity** (sometimes called a Dominance Index), which is calculated as 1 – D. The higher the value for this index, the higher the diversity of species.

## Formula
- `D = Σni(ni-1)  /  N(N-1)` 
- **ni:** The number of organisms that belong to species _i_
- **N:** The total number of organisms
