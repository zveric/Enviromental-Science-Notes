- Groundwater is held in rocks called **Aquifers**
- Aquifers are permeable and porous

## Porosity 
- Porosity measures the about of water that can be stored within rocks
![[Pasted image 20230208102326.png]]
- To calculate the porosity `volume of porespace / rock volume x 100`

## Permeability
- Permeable means that water can travel through the rock. 
- Swiss cheese is porous but not permeable
- Rocks must be porous to be permeable

## Aquifers

ADD PICTURE
- Confined aquifers are fully or partially covered by impermeable rocks.
- Unconfined Aquifers are directly recharged over their whole area. They are recharged quickly but are vulnerable to pollution.
- B is an artesian aqifer
- This means that the water in the valley is under hydro-static presure
