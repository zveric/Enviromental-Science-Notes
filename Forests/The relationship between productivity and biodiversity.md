## Non Indigenous Species
- Due to changes in fashions and needs, the types of trees grown in forests are not always indigenous.
- Our original forests were heavily exploited during the wars
- Fast-growing trees were planted to replace the old native trees
### Problems
- May not be able to support native insects and mammals especially birds (beak size)
- May flower at a later time affecting insects.
### Dutch Elm Disease
- Spread by fungus on bark beetles drinking from the bark of elm trees.
- Trees are cut down and burnt to stop the spread, this is cheaper than letting the disease spread.
- Insecticide can be sprayed on the trees to control beetle population.
- An epidemic of dutch elm disease happened in the 19-60's in Denver as too many of the same species ere planted at the same time.

## Single Species Plantations
- Mono-culture - The growth of a single crop in a given area
- Plantations can be very productive because they have few competitors 
- Close planting encourages trees to compete for light making them grow taller and straighter with fewer branches
- High productivity
- Low biodiversity
	- This is because the mono-culture fails to support a range of primary consumers so there is a limit to the number of secondary consumers.
	- Therefore mono-cultures are very vulnerable to ecological collapse

## Management of plantations
- Coppicing and pollarding are forest management methods

- Most tree plantations plant trees of the same age.
- This makes it easy to manage because large sections can be harvested at the same time. ​
- For planning purposes and incomes, this is very beneficial. ​
- However, it does reduce biodiversity. ​
- This is because all of the abiotic factors become less varied.

## Simple age structure
- In a natural, multi-age forest, there are trees and vegetation of differing ages and heights. ​
	- This means you trigger a range of abiotic factors across the forest. ​
- **Light**- you will find clearings and denser sections so species that want darker areas will thrive as well as species that need light. ​
- **Water** - denser areas gain less light so tend to be damper – again providing wetter areas for species that need it. ​
- A range of trees means a range of heights and ‘micro-climates’ this affects soil temperatures, air temperatures and humidity
