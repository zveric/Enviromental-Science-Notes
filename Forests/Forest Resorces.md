- Different types of forests include:

 - We need to know about 2 types of forest:
	 - **Broadleaf**
	 - **Rain forest**

## Resources
- Wide range of resources are available from forests
- Negative impacts on forests if over exploited

### Timber
- Wood is strong and versatile
#### Rain-forests woods
- Mahogany 
- teak 
- ebony 
- rosewood
#### Temperate
- Oak 
- Beech 
- Ash

### Food
- Provide us with food directly
- They provide food to animals that we can eat
- Some society's eat bush-meat

### Fibers
- Cotton is used to manufacture textiles
- Paper is made from wood fibres

### Medicines
- Trees may contain compounds, chemicals or components that can be used for medical purposes

## Ecosystem services
- Atmospheric regulators
- Act as a carbon store
- Made up of carbon
- When leaves drop carbon is released into the soil 


## Forest micro-climates
- Heat is absorbed by trees and re-radiated out at night keeping temperatures stable

## Light levels
- The canopy of the forest will absorb most of the light 
- This means that at the bottom of the forest floor must be able to survive with low light levels.

## Habitat refuge 
- 50% of species
- 6% of land area
- Each rain-forest is unique

## Biodiversity
- Hot and wet
- Nutrients are rapidly recycled
- Large areas are un-spoilt by humans


## Soil
- Forest help to produce soil
- Leaf litter is biodegraded into humus.
- Trees prevent winds reducing soil loss by wind
- The nutrient cycle is very fragile
- If the nutrient flow changes it can have an adverse impact on the ecosystem
- When deforestation occurs the litter layer no longer receives organic matter and the soil quickly becomes infertile
