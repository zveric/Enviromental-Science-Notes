- Dynamic equalibrium occurs when a system is in equalibrium between two states.
- Unlike other types of equlibrium there is fluctuations as either side of a reaction occur.
- Some examples of a dynamic equalibrium include:
	1. The regulation of greenhouse gasses powering the [[The Greenhouse Effect ]]
	2. Reactions occuring in the [[Stratospheric Ozone Layer]]
