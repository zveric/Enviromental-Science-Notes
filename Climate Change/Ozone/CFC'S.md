- Chlorofluorocarbons are gases that are incredibly unreactive in the troposphere
- They reach an altitude where they are able to react at the same height as the ozone layer
- They can break apart and bond with the oxygen atoms in ozone stopping the formation of the ozone layer
- This means that they are classified as one of the strongest [[Ozone Depleting Substances]]

## Uses
- Coolant in fridges
- Used to pressurise aerosols
- Used in fire extinguishers
