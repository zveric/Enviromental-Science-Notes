## MSY
- Timber industries, such as sawmilling and paper manufacturing, can be profitable long-term, only if the forest can be sustained. ​
- It involves harvesting a modest crop of timber year on year and counterbalancing losses by annual growth.​
- Lucaena trees used for firewood take seven years to grow while eucalyptus trees take ten. In theory, a sustained yield could be obtained by harvesting one-seventh or one-tenth of the trees being harvested, and planting more of them.
