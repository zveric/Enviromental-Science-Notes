- Forests can be managed by ensuring there are bodies out there that are monitoring them and working to support their growth.​

​

In 1993, the Rainforest Alliance co-founded the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), an international body that develops and maintains the most globally respected standard for managing forests.​

Businesses that work in a way that meet the criteria set out by the FSC

## Planting mixed species plantations ​
- Even where FSC certification is not available, forestry can be sustainable where plantations are of mixed species. ​
- This increases biodiversity, and the range of niches and food sources. ​
- Farmers plant alternating rows of fast-growing, nitrogen-fixing species and longer-lived hardwood species. The fast-growing species are planted closely together (1.5 metres) and the longer-lived species are planted 3 metres apart.​
- Planting indigenous species means that there will be more support in terms of food and shelter for other species in the ecosystem. ​
- For example- 
	- Alder is native to almost the whole of continental Europe.​
	- It grows well from seed and will quickly colonise bare ground. Because of its association with nitrogen-fixing bacterium, it can grow in nutrient-poor soils where few other trees thrive. ​
	- Alder is the food plant for the caterpillars of several moths including the alder kitten, pebble hook-tip, the autumnal and the blue-bordered carpet moth. ​
	- Catkins provide an early source of nectar and pollen for bees, and the seeds are eaten by the siskin, redpoll and goldfinch.​
	- The wet conditions found in alder woodland are ideal for mosses, lichens and fungi, along with the small pearl-bordered fritillary and chequered skipper butterflies, and some species of crane fly. Alder roots make the perfect nest sites for otters.​

## Mixed Age Structure
- Forestry plantations can be more sustainable where the plantation is mixed in age. Whilst the species may be the same, the range of ages provides a wider range of abiotic factors. ​
- Light levels will vary along with temperatures and wind velocity. ​
- This gives there more chance of increasing biodiversity. ​


## Selective Logging
- **Clear felling** – this is taking the whole of an area in one go. ​
	- This is easy and relatively quick. ​

- **Selective logging** is expensive because it requires going through the forest and picking out individual specimens. ​
	- Dragging these out of the forest is labour intensive and time consuming​
	- However, the clearings provided from selective felling provides the range in abiotic factors that can be attractive to species. ​
