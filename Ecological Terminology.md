## Biomes
- A biome is much bigger than an ecosystem. it covers a substantial geographical area and has a specific climate.
- A specific combination of species is usually found there - known as a community
- There are a number of factors that control where a biome exists, these are:
	- Temperature 
	- Light levels
	- Water availability 
	- Any seasonal fluctuations
- It is important not to confuse a biome with an ecosystem.
- Ecosystems often have the same name as a biome. e.g. Tropical rain-forests
- However there are many different tropical rain-forests: 
	- Indonesian
	- Amazon

## Taxonomy 
- Taxonomy is the science of grouping organisms according to similar features.
- Taxonomic groups are called **taxon**
- The grouping of organisms is mostly subjective ans opinions can change over time
- A species is always given a Latin name - this helps to ensure people from all around the world are talking about the same species.
- It is a binomial name - this means that the name has 2 parts.
	- 1st part is from its genus (the group it is most related to)
	- 2nd part is the specific name given to that exact species
