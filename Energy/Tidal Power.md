- Water is sucked towards the moon
- Geography of ocean basins may also influence the tides
	- Shallow / narrow inlets results in the funnelling of water raising the height of the tide

## The Severn estuary
- Second highest tidal range, 11 meters
- If a dam is built along the estuary the tidal height can be increased, raising the hydrolic head

### Location factors
- High tidal range (5-15 meters)
- Relatively close to an urban centre (for demand for energy)
- In the UK there is loads of opportunities for tidal barrages, especially in the south west


## Dragon Island

- The Swansea bay tidal scheme is a tidal lagoon power-plant
- 10 km long barrage
- Providing electricity for 150,000 families
- Tidal range is 7-9 meters
- 11.5 square kilometres 
- 650 million Â£
- High embodied energy
- 26 6 meter turbines
- Muscles farm



## Advantages of Tidal power
- Much more predictable than wind
- High energy density compared to winds
- Less visual impact than wind
## Disadvantages of Tidal power
- Destruction of ecosystems due to 
- Mud stopped from reaching sea
- Changes to erosion
- Lower water quality behind barrage
- Greater penetration of light 
- Potential for algal blooms
- Restriction on movement of animals
