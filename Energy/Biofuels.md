- **A biofuel** is a fuel derive from living matter, such as agricultural crops,forestry or fishery products, and variable forms of waste
	- **Primary biofuels** are organic materials that are used in there unprocessed forms
	- **Secondary biofuels** are processed fuels from organic materials
- Plants convert light energy from the sun into chemical energ through photosynthesis

## Biomass
### Straw
- waste product from cerial crops
- Clooected dried and burnt to generate electricity
- Used in the east of England (eg cambridge)
#### Pros
- Carbon neutral
- Uses a waste product
- Renewable

#### Cons
- Low energy density
	- So cant be transported long distances economically
- Small scale
### Wood and charcole
- About 400 hectares of willow provides enough envergy for 5000 houses
- Hati has high levels of deforistation as they use wood as there main source of fuel
- 98% of forests have been cut down


### Biogas
- Fermentation of sewage and manure in the absence of oxygen reates methene.
- Methane can be burnt

#### Wood:

1. **Natural Biomass:**
    
    - Wood is a natural and renewable biomass resource obtained from trees, primarily composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin.
2. **Energy Content:**
    
    - Used as a traditional source of energy for heating and cooking due to its combustible nature.
    - Releases energy when burned, and the amount of energy depends on the type of wood and its moisture content.
3. **Forms of Utilization:**
    
    - **Firewood:** Logs or split wood used in open fires, stoves, or traditional fireplaces.
    - **Pellets:** Processed wood compressed into small pellets for efficient combustion in pellet stoves and biomass boilers.
4. **Environmental Impact:**
    
    - Burning wood releases carbon dioxide, but if harvested sustainably, it is considered carbon-neutral as new trees absorb CO2 during growth.
5. **Challenges:**
    
    - Deforestation and unsustainable logging practices can lead to environmental degradation.
    - Efficient combustion and use of wood require proper equipment and practices to minimize air pollution.
6. **Applications:**
    
    - Besides energy, wood is used in construction, furniture, paper production, and various other industries.

#### Charcoal:

1. **Production:**
    
    - Charcoal is produced by heating wood in the absence of oxygen through a process called pyrolysis. This removes volatile components, leaving behind carbon-rich charcoal.
2. **Energy Density:**
    
    - Charcoal has a higher energy density than wood because it is mostly carbon. This makes it a more efficient fuel for cooking and heating.
3. **Cooking and Industrial Uses:**
    
    - Commonly used in cooking, especially in areas without access to other fuels. It is favored for barbecues, grilling, and outdoor cooking.
    - Used in industrial processes, such as metal smelting, due to its high heat output.
4. **Smokeless Varieties:**
    
    - Some charcoals are designed to be smokeless, reducing air pollution and respiratory issues associated with traditional wood fires.
5. **Environmental Impact:**
    
    - Charcoal production can contribute to deforestation if not done sustainably. However, sustainable charcoal production methods, such as using waste wood, are being developed.
6. **Activated Charcoal:**
    
    - Activated charcoal is a specially processed form used for medicinal and filtration purposes due to its high surface area and adsorption properties.
7. **Alternative to Coal:**
    
    - Charcoal is sometimes used as a substitute for coal in certain industrial processes and as a fuel in regions where coal is scarce.
8. **Economic Importance:**
    
    - Charcoal production is a significant industry in various regions, providing livelihoods for many communities.





1. **Bioethanol:**
    
    - _Source:_ Typically derived from sugars or starches found in crops such as corn, sugarcane, and wheat.
    - _Production:_ Fermentation of sugars into ethanol using yeast.
    - _Use:_ Blended with gasoline to produce ethanol fuels, such as E10 (10% ethanol) or E85 (85% ethanol).
2. **Biodiesel:**
    
    - _Source:_ Often produced from vegetable oils (like soybean oil, canola oil) or animal fats.
    - _Production:_ Transesterification process converts oils or fats into biodiesel and glycerol.
    - _Use:_ Blended with diesel fuel, reducing emissions and enhancing lubricity.
3. **Biogas:**
    
    - _Source:_ Produced through the anaerobic digestion of organic matter, including agricultural residues, manure, and wastewater.
    - _Composition:_ Mainly consists of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2).
    - _Use:_ Can be used directly for heating, electricity generation, or as a vehicle fuel.
4. **Cellulosic Ethanol:**
    
    - _Source:_ Derived from cellulose-rich materials, such as agricultural residues (corn stover, wheat straw), switchgrass, and forestry residues.
    - _Production:_ Utilizes advanced processes to break down complex carbohydrates into sugars, which are then fermented into ethanol.
    - _Benefits:_ Overcomes the food vs. fuel debate as it doesn't rely on food crops.
5. **Algae-based Biofuels:**
    
    - _Source:_ Produced from microalgae that contain high lipid content.
    - _Production:_ Algae are cultivated and processed to extract lipids, which can be converted into biodiesel.
    - _Advantages:_ Can have higher lipid yields compared to traditional oilseed crops; doesn't compete with food crops for arable land.
6. **Syngas (Synthetic Gas):**
    
    - _Source:_ Produced through gasification of biomass (wood, agricultural residues).
    - _Composition:_ A mixture of hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO).
    - _Use:_ Can be converted into liquid fuels like synthetic diesel or aviation fuels through Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.
7. **Methanol:**
    
    - _Source:_ Can be produced from a variety of feedstocks, including natural gas, biomass, or even carbon dioxide.
    - _Production:_ Synthesized through chemical processes, such as steam methane reforming or biomass gasification.
    - _Use:_ Can be used as a fuel or as a feedstock for the production of other chemicals.
8. **Hydrogen from Biomass:**
    
    - _Source:_ Hydrogen can be produced through the gasification of biomass, where biomass is converted into a hydrogen-rich gas.
    - _Production:_ Gasification followed by water-gas shift reactions.
    - _Use:_ Can be used as a clean fuel for various applications, including transportation and industrial processes.
