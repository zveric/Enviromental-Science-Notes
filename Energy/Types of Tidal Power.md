- [[Tidal Power]] can be generated in a wide variety of ways.

## Tidal Barrages
- A dam across a bay of estuary
- High environmental cost
- High efficiency
- High financial cost / embodied energy

## Tidal Lagoons
- Only part of an estuary is affected
- Environmentally sensitive areas can be avoided

## In Stream Turbines
- Fixed to the seabed
- Absorb kinetic energy of tidal flow
- Not very efficient
- Low environmental impacts
