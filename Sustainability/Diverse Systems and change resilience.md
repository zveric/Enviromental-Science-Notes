## Diverse Ecosystems
- Diverse ecosystems are those that have lots of links and niches within them.
- They are more resilient to change
- When a change event occurs, and a species is affected, it usually has only limited consequences in the system because there are other species available. ​
	- What ecosystems might be resilient?​
		- Rainforests​
		- Coral Reefs​
		- Deciduous Forests
## Agri-Systems
- These are not diverse, they suffer substantial collapse if there is a change. ​
- This is because there is so little range in species that if one dies the system fails. ​
- In agri systems there are usually very few ​
- Detritivores or pollinators for example.
