## The International Union for Conservation of Nature

### Roles of the IUNC
- Coordinating global data on biodiversity conservation 
- Increasing understanding of the importance of biodiversity
- Deploying nature based solutions to global challenges such as the climate, food, and sustainable development

## The red-list 
- The red-list is a categorisation of species depending on how vulnerable they are.

#### Categories 

- [Extinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction "Extinction") (EX) – beyond reasonable doubt that the species no longer exists.
- [Extinct in the wild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct_in_the_wild "Extinct in the wild") (EW) – survives only in captivity, cultivation and/or outside native range, as presumed after exhaustive surveys.
- [Critically endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critically_endangered_species "Critically endangered species") (CR) – in a particularly and extremely critical state.
- [Endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species "Endangered species") (EN) – very high risk of extinction in the wild, meets any of criteria A to E for Endangered.
- [Vulnerable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species "Vulnerable species") (VU) – meets one of the 5 Red List criteria and thus considered to be at high risk of unnatural (human-caused) extinction without further human intervention.
- [Near threatened](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_threatened "Near threatened") (NT) – close to being endangered in the near future.
- [Least concern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_concern "Least concern") (LC) – unlikely to become endangered or extinct in the near future.
- [Data deficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_deficient "Data deficient") (DD)
- [Not evaluated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_evaluated "Not evaluated") (NE)

### Criteria for categorisation
- Habitat under particular threat
- Evolutionary unique species (EDGE)
- Endemic species
- Keystone species
- Flagship species
- Degree of population dispersal
