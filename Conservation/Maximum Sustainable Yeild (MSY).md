- The maximum sustainable yield is the largest yield that can be taken from a species stock over an indefinite period.
- MSY aims to keep the population at the maximum growth rate

## Data collection 
- Collecting data is hard.
- The only easy piece of data to find is Y
- This is because all catch is landed
- The rest of the data is difficult as fish migrate
- Data from a large number of shoals would be needed but this isn't always practical
- By comparing data from unexploited shoals to exploited shoals it is possible to understand whether over-exploitation is taking place

## Methods of Population sampling from commercial fishing

### Catch Size
- The total landed catch is not always safe to use
- We may be able to find new methods of capture, this will for a few years make catch stable whilst in reality stocks are declining. ​
### Catch per unit fishing effort
- An indirect measure of the abundance of a target species. 
- Declines in CPUE may mean that the fish population cannot support the level of harvesting. ​
### Mean Fish size
- Total biomass of catch could remain the same. 
- This can hide the truth. 
- But if fish size is measured we can see if fish size is becoming smaller, suggesting adults are being caught too fast. ​
### Mean age
- Age is determined by growth rings on scales. 
- Or bones in ears (otoliths)  
- If the mean age is reducing then over-fishing is occurring. ​

## Data from research
- We can’t rely on data from catches. ​
- This is because most fish die as larvae due to being eaten, or as they are carried on currents into polluted areas /danger. ​
- This means only monitoring adult fish cannot predict future changes. ​
- Scientific research is carried out on eggs and larvae. This can help us predict FUTURE stocks
- Researchers will take ships out and study the egg and larvae density and work out the success rate of larvae into becoming juvenile fish. Good survival rates tend to suggest good changes of surviving into adulthood and on going fish stocks.
