- Maintaining Genetic variation is on of the main [[Reasons For Conservation]]

## Crop Breeding Programs
- Domesticated crops often lack genetic diversity because they have been produced from a limited number of original plants. 
- Desirable Characteristics from **CWR** species are being searched for to help to increase the resilience of these domesticated crops.

### Characteristics introduced from CWR species

### Disease Resistance 
- Sugar Cane has been protected from the sugar cane mollusc virus by cross breeding with a wild sugar cane variety from Indonesia
- Tomatoes have been cross bred with a tomato species that has high disease tolerance

## Salt Tolerance
- Salt resistant crops are important for many communities as they are much more resilient when being grown in coastal saline soil
- Kale is being studied to see if its salt resistant genes can be transferred through cross breeding

## Resistance to Drought 
- Varieties of cacao, the source of chocolate, that are more drought tolerant have been developed by cross breeding these plants with plants from the amazon rain-forest.
