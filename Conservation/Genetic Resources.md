- Maintaining Genetic variation is on of the main [[Reasons For Conservation]]

## Crop Breeding Programs
- Domesticated crops often lack genetic diversity because they have been produced from a limited number of original plants. 
- Desirable Characteristics from **CWR** species are being searched for to help to increase the resilience of these domesticated crops.

### Characteristics introduced from CWR species

#### Disease Resistance 
- Sugar Cane has been protected from the sugar cane mollusc virus by cross breeding with a wild sugar cane variety from Indonesia
- Tomatoes have been cross bred with a tomato species that has high disease tolerance

#### Salt Tolerance
- Salt resistant crops are important for many communities as they are much more resilient when being grown in coastal saline soil
- Kale is being studied to see if its salt resistant genes can be transferred through cross breeding

#### Resistance to Drought 
- Varieties of cacao, the source of chocolate, that are more drought tolerant have been developed by cross breeding these plants with plants from the amazon rain-forest.

#### Higher Yields
- Palm oil yields have increased by 25% after being bred with wild relatives found in central Africa

#### Improved taste or appearance
- Selective breeding for desirable characteristics such as shelf life and improved appearance can help to reduce waste as well as costs to shops.

#### Nutrient uptake 
- Many recently developed wheat varieties do not form a string link with mycorrhizal fungi in the soil. This can reduce their nutrient uptake
- Breeding programs with wild wheat is attempting to build better associations between wheat plants and the mycorrhizal fungi

## Centres of diversity
- Areas with a high concentration of close relatives to domestic crops are called **Centres of diversity**, **Centres of origin** or **Vavilov Centres**.
- Unfortunately these centres are often in areas where environmental degradation is threatening the survival of the remaining CWR species

## Gene pool problems 
- The gene pool of domesticated crop is pretty low meaning that they are genetically similar making crops more susceptible to genetic conditions.
