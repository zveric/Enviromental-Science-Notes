- Similar to agriculture, aquaculture is the control of aquatic systems to increase aquatic productivity. ​
- It is similar in that Extensive Aquaculture tends to be lower in terms of inputs and is usually subsistence, but could be commercial. ​
- It is particularly common in Central and Eastern Europe. ​
- This farming method consists of maintaining ponds (natural or artificial) in such a way that they foster aquatic fauna.
- Intensive Aquaculture is high input and is very much commercial. ​
- Intensive Aquaculture usually requires full control of all abiotic factors​
- An **intensive freshwater fish farming site** is generally composed of several open-air concrete tanks, raceways or earth ponds of different sizes and depths suited to the different stages of growth of the fish.​
### Intensive sea farming
- Sea cages hold fish captive in a large pocket-shaped net anchored to the bottom and on the surface by a rectangular or circular floating framework. They are widely used for rearing finfish, such as salmon, sea bass and sea bream

## Species Selection
- The species that are farmed are dependent on the local conditions. ​
- Some fish prefer cooler conditions such as Trout or Salmon. ​
- Some fish need warmer waters such as Freshwater Shrimp and Tilapia. ​
- **Market demand** also affects the choice of fish species raised. ​
- The most popular ‘eaten’ organisms are fish however, a lot of fish ‘products’ exist such as seaweed in products from toothpaste to fertilisers for crops. ​
- As a general rule carnivorous fish as Salmon or trout are the most popular due to their flavour so these make up a large market share. ​
- However, in low income countries, species are often selected for their ability to grow on natural producers as this is cheaper. ​
- These fish will eat plankton, waste and natural vegetation- Carp, Shrimp and Tilapia. ​
​
- When selecting for Aquaculture, the characteristics required are 3 key things:​
	- Good resistance to diseases (these fish will swim in close proximity to others in small, confined spaces)​
	- Fast growth rate for maximum outputs​
	- A Good appearance for sale

## Genetic Control
- **In some species of fish, the meat from one sex tastes better.**
- In Rainbow Trout the female has better meat and so the market for female trout is better. 
- This encourages fish farmers to grow more females. This can be artificially induced. ​

- Fish sex can be changed hormonally if hormones are given to the fish early in their growth.
- **Female hormones can be given to allow all the fish to develop into females.**  ​

- In Tilapia (a type of fish) the males are bigger and more energy efficient (reduced inputs) so the fish are treated with hormones to create  all males. ​
- This produces a bigger harvest.

### Preventing hybridisation
- Escaped fish from fish farms can be problematic if they survive, breed and then out compete wild varieties. ​
- To prevent the risks it is possible to form Triploid fish. ​
- These have 3 sets of chromosomes and this makes them infertile. ​
- It can be done by treating fertilised eggs with heat, allowing them to hatch but changing the chromosomes.​

## Disease Control
- Diseases in Aquaculture is a big problem. ​
- This is because fish are stocked at high density so coming into contact with another fish is high 
- Lower stocking densities will lessen disease spread. ​
- Water flow from youngest tanks to older fish tanks also mean younger fish are less likely to get a disease from older fish. ​
- Some fisheries also use **biological control methods**. For example the use of **Wrasse to eat lice (the vector spreading diseases)**

## Control of Competition
- In modern fisheries competition isn’t an issue because the fish are in secure, netted compounds and other fish cannot access them. ​
- Birds can be an issue but top nets can be used or bird scarers. In some places laser bird deterrents are used.
- Seal Scarers are sometimes used

## Control of nutrition
- The food the fish need depends on the species. ​
- Carnivorous fish will need feeding as their netted enclosures means no fish to prey on. ​
- Herbivorous fish can survive on the water in their pond or water currents in their enclosure but the high density of fish often means supplementary feeding is needed. ​
- There is a large drive to reduce the amount of fishmeal being fed- what’s fishmeal? ​
- Ground up and pelleted bits of other fish. ​

## A-biotic Factors
- Temperature control will depend on the needs of the species. ​
- Warmer water can help fish increase growth rates but some species get stressed at higher temps due to reduced dissolved oxygen content. ​
- ​Trout like high DO. This means farmers must raise the oxygen content using aeration. ​
- Waste increases microbial growth, which in turn decreases DO. ​
- So tanks must be cleaned and wastes continually removed. ​
- Carp are more tolerant as they are bottom feeders so are used to lower DO​

### Light levels

- Fish reproduction is triggered by day length. ​
- This may be important for harvests in some species e.g. Salmon – they stop growing when they reach sexual maturity. ​
- Long days delay the fish from reaching sexual maturity so they keep growing. ​

### Water flow

- Fish like to swim against the current. ​
- Producing a current encourages fish to swim in the same direction. ​
- This reduces contact and can help reduce disease spread. ​
- It can also help prevent injuries ​

## Can Aqua Culture replace fishing
- There is a view that aquaculture is a technical solution to the sustainability troubles facing wild marine fish.​
- Despite rapid growth in aquaculture in the last 40-odd years–which is now the fastest-growing food sector in the world–it doesn’t appear to have shifted the focus away from wild fish​
- One issue is tropic level efficiency. ​
- Tilapia are very energy efficient- converting food to protein/meat  so the amount of food per unit area is high. ​
- Carnivorous fish are not so efficient, more inputs must be put in per yield. However, they are more popular e.g. Salmon. ​
- Fish do not need to use energy to keep warm so this means they convert their food more efficiently. ​
- Some species of fish do not breed well in captivity so cannot easily be farmed. ​
- This means aquaculture cannot fully replace wild fish farming. ​
- Tuna is an example. There must be wild stocks of Tuna if we wish to continue eating them. ​
- So generally they can produce a 1Kg of food with lower input than many land farmed animals.​
- Finally carnivorous fish eat fish meal. Some fish meal is made of marine species eaten by other species. ​
- Sandeels are commonly used for fish meal because they are not really used for human consumption. ​
- This has meant there are fewer sandeels available for bird species such as Terns or Puffins.  ​



## Extensive oyster aquaculture
- Oyster farms use extensive systems with low inputs. Oysters filter plantonic organisms from seawater

- Total productivity may be increased if they are stored in the same space as long as they aren't competitors.
