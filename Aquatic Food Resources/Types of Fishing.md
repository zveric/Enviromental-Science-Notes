### Pelagic Trawling 
- This is the fishing of species that live in the mid to upper layers of the open seas.
- Trawling is specifically used for species that shoal- herrings, bass and mackerel.
- These shoaling species usually collect as single species, so the risk of by catch is low.
- However, the risk of catching predator species such as dolphins and porpoises is high.

### Drift nets
- Also used for pelagic species, but those that swim a little closer to the surface such as Tuna.
- They have floats at the top to stop the net from sinking.
- They are like long curtains- fish being caught when they swim into it and the meshes of the net become caught behind their gills
- The fact that driftnets operate generally near to the air-surface interface makes them especially likely to catch air breathing animals

- ### Purse seining
- A school of fish is gradually encircled by a long wall of netting, possibly as long as 1 Km, hanging in the water and towed into a circle
- This is used on fish that shoal. Typically Sardines, herring and anchovies.
- It is called purse seining because the net is drawn in like a drawstring purse.

### Long Lining
- This is a baited long line running to KMs. (45Km is not unheard of!)
- The long-line set can be suspended at any depth within the water column, depending on target species.
- The typical species is Tuna & Swordfish. The lines are set with bait and the fish eat the bait and are caught on the hooks.
- They can be left to ‘soak’ for hours /a day so a flexible way to fish.
- By-catch can be a problem- Turtles entangled or hooked at depth likely drown because they cannot reach the surface to breathe.

- Current by-catch reduction measures include the use of _**circle hooks**_, with the shape and smaller opening reducing the likelihood of turtles and marine mammals ingesting hooks or being caught. When hookings do occur, they are superficial and primarily in the mouth

- ## Demersal fishing
- The fishing of species that exist on or feed from the sea bed.

- ### Demersal trawling
- Covers several gear types, all of which use a cone-like net with a closed end (cod-end) that holds the catch.
- These nets are towed by one or two boats and are designed to catch fish living at great depths or on the bottom of the sea such as cod, haddock and plaice.
- Damage and disturbance to the seabed and bottom living marine animals occurs as the fishing gear comes into contact with the ocean floor.
- Bottom living fish often congregate in mixed species groups so trawling for a particular species can be associated with by-catch of non-target fish and other marine life

### Demersal long-lines 
- This is similar to pelagic fishing but the lines are set on the sea floor.
- Typical species include cod and haddock.
- Long lining tends to be done because the fish tends to better due to less compression damage when caught in nets via trawling or in pelagic fishing via purse seining.
- It also causes less damage to the sea bed than trawling.
- It is also possible to put selective baits down. E.g. where numbers of cod are low haddock can be caught using bait only eaten by haddock.

## Shellfish traps
- Shellfish are crustaceans such as crabs, lobsters and crayfish
- The traps are baited and lowered to the sea floor where they capture specific shellfish dependent on the trap style.
