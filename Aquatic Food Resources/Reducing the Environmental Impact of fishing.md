## Catch quota
- A catch quota can work in reducing over-fishing is the species within the quota is a single shoal species. ​
- If they mix, then they could still be caught amongst the other species and end up thrown back in the sea dead​
- This is because the quota only ‘counts’ the fish that are landed. ​
- In addition, a weakness in quota policy appears to be the lack of mandated marine protected areas (MPAs) to assist fish stocks to recover. Without these zones, fish stocks will struggle under mass-production fishing.​

## Netdesign
- Improvements in net design can help to avoid fishing above the [[Maximum Sustainable Yeild (MSY)]]
- Mesh that is bigger can allow juvenile fish to escape
	- A problem with large net holes is that they can stretch out of shape meaning that fish are no longer be to escape
	- Ridged plastic holes with LED's on them can further reduce by-catch.

## Escape Panels
- TED's can allow turtles to escape from nets

## Dolphin Pingers
- These are added to nets and emit a high frequency that the dolphins dislike. ​
- The dolphins are warned the net is there and this reduces the chance of them getting caught up.
