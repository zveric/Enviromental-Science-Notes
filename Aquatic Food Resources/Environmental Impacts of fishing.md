## Quota
- The total allowable catch allocated to each fishing nation- this is then split to each fishery or company. It is the total allowable catch​
## Over-fishing
- The main impact of fishing is that populations of fish have declined. This is due to over-fishing.​
	- If Mortality is greater than birth rates the population will shrink.  ​
	- Simply, to prevent collapse of fish stocks, the fish need to be allowed to reproduce before being caught. ​
	- They need to be allowed to reach maturity. ​

## By-catch 
- The unwanted fish and other marine creatures trapped by commercial fishing nets during fishing for a different species.​
	- by-catch can also be immature fish​
		- These are fish that are often illegal to catch, so cannot be landed. They are caught by accident during fishing and then thrown back out.
- By-catch is often caused when a trawler catches more than their **quotas**
### By-catch effects of different types of fishing
- **Long-lines**, **trawling** and the use of **gill-nets** are the fishing methods that most commonly result in by-catch.
- With **demersal trawling**, boats drag large nets along the seabed, catching almost everything in their path.

## Habitat Damage
- Demersal trawling can damage the seabed. 
- As the gear is dragged it scrapes the sea floor. 
- Corals are particularly affected.  
- Sandy areas generally recover but corals are slow growing.​
- **Sea-grass beds** are also easily damaged. They are nursery areas for spawning fish​
	- Sea-grass is also effective at holding the sand together with its roots. 
	- When damaged the grass is ripped out of the sand making the currents move the sand affecting sedimentation and further colonisation. ​
- **Coral polyps** are easily killed as they are squashed by the ropes, nets or traps used. ​

## Fish Populations
- As long as they are not over fished, the population of fish will renew- this makes them a renewable resource. ​
- **Fishing itself is not bad**​
	- This is because fish always breed more than is needed because there is an ‘assumption’ that not all will survive​
	- Additionally, when some adults are caught, juveniles are more likely to survive and become part of the adult population. ​
- Decline in fish populations only happens when too many adults are caught prevent the highest breeding stocks to be removed. ​
