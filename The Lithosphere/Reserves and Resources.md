## Cut off ore grade
- The minimum percentage of metal which is economically viable to mine
- The more valuable the substance is the lower the cut off ore grade will be

### Variations in the coog
- Demand - The higher the demand , the lower its cut off grade will be as the price of the metal will rise
- Abundance - Scarce metals will have a low cut of grade as they will be more expensive
- Size of Deposit - Smaller deposits will have a greater cut off grade as they will be used up quicker
- Cost of extraction - If it is costly to mine, the cut off grade will be higher as profit needs to be maximised
