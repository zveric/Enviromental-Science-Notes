## Reserve
- The amount that can be exploited at the current time while generating a profit.

## Resource 
- All the material the could be exploited in the future with better tech / economic times

## Grade of deposits
- The grade of a deposit is simply the amount of metal present in the deposit
- This is usually written in % or PPM (Parts per million)

## Cut off ore grade
- The minimum percentage of metal which is economically viable to mine
- The more valuable the substance is the lower the cut off ore grade will be
- **Cut-Off Grade = Average Crustal Abundance X Minimum Concentration Factor**

### Variations in the COOG
- Demand - The higher the demand , the lower its cut off grade will be as the price of the metal will rise
- Abundance - Scarce metals will have a low cut of grade as they will be more expensive
- Size of Deposit - Smaller deposits will have a greater cut off grade as they will be used up quicker
- Cost of extraction - If it is costly to mine, the cut off grade will be higher as profit needs to be maximised

## The average crustal abundance
- The average crustal abundance is the mean % of the metal in the lithosphere
- The **Minimum concentration factor** is the number of times greater than the average the metal must be concentrated to reach the COOG
