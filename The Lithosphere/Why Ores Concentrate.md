## Alluvial Deposits
- Dense materials (eg: gold, diamond) drop out of slow moving water. Therefore finer material is transported further.
- This can lead to a build up of minerals called a **Placer**

- Although in the UK we don't have large amounts of gold the same processes occur with sands and gravels called Aggregates.
### Agregate
- Aggregate is the most mined material in the world
- It is a broad category of 'bulk materials' 
- It is used in construction

## Evaporites
- These are minerals that form rocks such as halite.
- Halite is in lots of products
- It is just a name for salt!
- Salts form in order of solubility
- Lithium can be mined from some salt lakes

## Biological Sediments
- Biological sediments are simply sediments formed form once living organisms
- There are three main types of biological sediments.
	- Coal - Formed over millions of years from vegetation;n in swamps
	- Oil - Made over million of years from the death of millions of tiny planktonic organisms in seas
	- Limestone / Chalk - Formed from the shells of tiny dead marine creatures, slowly crushed and compacted over time to form rock.
