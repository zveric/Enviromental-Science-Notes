- Previously used elements can be reused if they are separated 
- This is more sustainable than freshly extracted material.
- Material to be recycled can be split into 2 categories
	- **pre-consumer wastes** = waste products from the manufacturing process.
	- **post-consumer wastes** = discarded consumer products

## Problems with recycling
- **Transport** = Transportation of waste before it is recycled is often prohibitively expensive
- **Labour costs** = Processing smaller quantities of materials increases labour costs. However jobs in recycling are often low skilled meaning that the availability of labour is high.
- **Separation** = Alloys of metals can be hard to separate meaning that recycled aluminium alloys often cant be used where pure aluminium is required
- **Identification** = It is labour intensive and slow to identify each piece of wastes composition
- **Public Cooperation** = Post-consumer waste recycling requires the cooperation of the general public.
- **Waste Losses** = Not all materials sent to a recycling plant can be recycled. Some recyclable waste is also lost to litter.

## Cradle to Cradle Design
- Cradle to Cradle Design is where a product is designed with its disposal in mind.
