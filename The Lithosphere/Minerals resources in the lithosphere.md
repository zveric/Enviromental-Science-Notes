- Inside the lithosphere there are many minerals that are used in everyday life
- Most of these minerals are non renewable meaning that they are renewing them selves much slower than we are extracting them
- This means that we have 3 possible outcomes:
	- We run out and have to find alternatives
	- We find new sources of them using new technology
	- We recycle those that can be recycled
