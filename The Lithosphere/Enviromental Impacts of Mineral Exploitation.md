## Land Take
- Mineral Extraction may cause conflicts with other local land uses
- As there is a limited choices of location that can be easily exploited land use conflicts are more common
- Land is also required for other processes involved with mining such as over burden dumping and access routes
- 

## Habitat Loss
- The loss of species where the mineral is to be extracted is unavoidable as the surface habitat will be disrupted/moved
- The relocation of wildlife around the site is rarely completely successful as it is often hard to trap and move all species involved
- Habitat restoration after mineral extraction has completed if often attempted. New habitats such as wetlands are created. In many countries (including the UK) restoration of habitats is a prerequisite for mining to take place.
- Sand and gravel extraction from sea beds is completed in areas with high currents (meaning that sea life on the sea floor (benthic organisms) is limited).

## Loss of Amenity
- Mining changes the landscape and create aesthetic complaints from locals.
- These negative effects can be alleviated through landscaping and tree planting

## Dust
- Blasting and the movement of mining vehicles can cause dust.
- This dust is lifted into the atmosphere creating pollution
- Vehicles can be sprayed with water to help reduce the dust created

## Noise Pollution
- Mine vehicles and rock blasting can created high levels of noise
- This noise can effect local residents as well as local ecosystems
- Embankments created around mines can be created to help to absorb and deflect the noise created

## Turbid Drainage Water
- Mine drainage water contains suspended solids
- These sospended soilds reduce water quality reduing light penetration into rivers
- The turbitity of water can be reduced by using sedimentaion lagoons.

## Spoil Disposal
- Spoil is the waste material left behind by mining.
- I can contain overburden material
