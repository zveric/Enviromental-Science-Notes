## Lithosphere
- The 'rocky' sphere
- Includes the rigid crust and the upper mantle
- Brittle + Hard
- Divided into plates
- We are on the Eurasian plate

## Asthenosphere
- The 'weak' sphere
- Part of the upper mantle that is able to flow
- However it is still solid (it has similar to properties to science putty)

## Igneous Rocks
- Magma is created in the earths core
- Igneous rocks are created when this magma (or lava) crystallise
- They are made from crystals (criltiline) and are therefore very hard
- As they aren't laid down in beds there is no layering
- There is no fossils within them
### Extrusive
- Erupted above the surface (lava and ash)
- Cool quickly
- Basalt is an example of this (it is used in tarmac)
## Intrusive
- Cooled below the surface from magma
- Cool slowly

### Minerals
- The building blocks of rocks
- Inorganic natural solids
- Fixed chemical formula
- Usually form crystals (crystaline)
