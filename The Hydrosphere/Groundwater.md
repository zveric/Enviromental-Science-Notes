- Groundwater is held in rocks called **Aquifers**
- Aquifers are permeable and porous

## Porosity 
- Porosity measures the about of water that can be stored within rocks
![[Pasted image 20230208102326.png]]
- To calculate the porosity `volume of porespace / rock volume x 100`

## Permeability
- Permeable means that water can travel through the rock. 
- Swiss cheese is porous but not permeable
- Rocks must be porous to be permeable

## Aquifers

- Confined aquifers are fully or partially covered by impermeable rocks.
- Unconfined Aquifers are directly recharged over their whole area. They are recharged quickly but are vulnerable to pollution.
- **F** is a spring.
### Artesian aquifer
- **B** in the diagram represents an Artesian aquifer
- Artesian Aquifers are confined aquifers which have been folded so the water table is higher at the recharge zones
- This means that the water in the valley is under hydro-static pressure.
- If a well is sunk the water will naturally flow up until the pressure is balanced (This is called the potentiometric surface)
- At **D** the potentiometric surface is above the ground level so water naturally flows to the surface
- At **E** water rises due to the hydro-static forces but doesn't flow to the surface
- As **A** isn't a Artesian aquifer so there is no hydro-static forces on the water in well **G**
