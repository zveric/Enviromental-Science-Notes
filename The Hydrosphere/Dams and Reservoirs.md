- An example of surface water storage
- Due to the temporal mismatch in [[River discharge]] water often needs to be stored allowing us to abstract the water when we need it
- Reservoirs may be created by diverting a river to flood land including villages
- A dam may also be built across a river

## Dams
## Choice of site

## Positives
- Guarantee a year round supply of water
- Prevent Flooding
- Generate HEP (Hydroelectric power)
- Reservoirs have non extractive uses. (water Sports)
- Wildlife Habitat

## Negatives
- Destruction of structure of river
- Creation of sandbanks
- Release of greenhouse gasses
- Reduced flooding downstream reduces fertility of land
- Reduced sediment downstream causing a lack of river estuary. This causes coastal erosion
- It is a barrier to fish migration (83% drop in in fish numbers in the last 50 years)
- Changes in micro-climate
- Algae blooms due to agricultural run off causes eutrophication
