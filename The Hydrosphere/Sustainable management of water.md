## Artificial recharge of aquifers

- Water from aquifers may be extracted during dry seasons
- The recharge rate may be slow during wet seasons If the infiltration capacity of the surface rock is exceeded 
- To combat falling water levels in aquifers during periods of high rainfall water can be used to fill up the aquifers. This can be achieved in two distinct ways:
	- Water can be pumped directly into the aquifer through boreholes 
	- Water can be redirected to lagoons where it can absorb into the aquifer naturally

## River regulation reservoir

- Human activities often extenuate extremes in river flow.
- Activities such as deforestation and urbanisation can lead to erratic river discharge

- Reservoirs can be used to regulate these extremes. During periods of low rainfall the reservoirs are used to maintain consistent river levels by opening the dam to allow more water into the river. In periods of high rainfall the reservoir is used to hold back excess water preventing dangerous floods
### Advantages
- Monsoon climate - holds water for times of water deficit
