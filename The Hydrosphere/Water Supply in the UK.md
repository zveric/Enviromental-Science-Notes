- There is a mismatch between supply and demand
- Although the UK has enough water the supply isn't always in the right place at the right time

## Spatial Mismatch
- The north west of England, Wales, and Scotland have a water surplus
- Whereas the south has a water deficit

## Large scale water transport
- Very expensive

## Temporal Mismatch
- There is more precipitation in the winter than the summer
- This mismatch is called a temporal mismatch

### Storage
- In [[Dams and Reservoirs]]
- Recharging aquifers with river water
- These methods are used to store water for use in summer
