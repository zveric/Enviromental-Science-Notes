## Spatial Mismatch
- The north west of England, Wales, and Scotland have a water surplus

## Large scale water transport
- Very expensive

## Temporal Mismatch
- There is a mismatch between supply and demand
- Although the UK has enough water the supply isn't always in the right place at the right time
- This mismatch is called a temporal mismatch
### Storage
- In reservoirs or water tanks
- Recharging aquifers with river water
- These methods are used to store water for use in summer
