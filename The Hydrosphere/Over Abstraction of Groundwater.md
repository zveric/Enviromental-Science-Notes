- Water is being abstracted from aquifers quicker than it can be replaced
- This is unsustainable

## California
- Dry and Arid
- Richest and most populous state 
- Lots of high quality soil
- Half the fruit and vegetable produced in the USA are grown here
- The groundwater is used unsustainably (80% used for agriculture)
- The water table has dropped 40 meters 
- The water is polluted by pesticides.
- The ground has subsided 20 meters

## High Planes Aquifer
- Wheat farms
- 174000 square miles
- Its a fossil aquifer (containing paleo-water) meaning there is no active recharge
- Without irrigation the land is too dry and cold 
- As the Aquifer is draining at approximately 2 ft a year farming may eventually become impossible

## Cone of Depression
![[Pasted image 20230216153932.png]]
- Over abstraction of water causes the water table to drop locally causing a **cone of depression**. 
- The overall vertical reduction in height of the water table is the **draw down**. 
- This cone of depression can cause the now dry sediment to compact causing subsidence.
- Once this occurs the ground can never become porous again.

### Salt water incursion
- Salt-water incursion is the movement of saline water into freshwater aquifers
- This is caused because sea water has a higher density than freshwater.
- When freshwater is drawn faster than it can be recharged the water table is drawn down. 
- This reduction in pressure causes slat water to flow into the fresh water aquifer
